# Exploring-Patient-Records-and-Medical-Trends-using-Excel
Introduction
In this project, I carried out analysis on a dataset containing patient's records as well as their medical trends in chronic diseases to derive insights of the patterns of these diseases and how they are managed. I focused on features such as patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment details, etc.  

AIM

The aim of this project was to unveil patterns and correlations inherent in the health dataset, which is focused on chronic diseases such as Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity among old and young people. Additionally, this project aimed to provide actionable insights for healthcare decision makers in curbing these chronic diseases.

SCOPE

In this project, I utilized Excel features such as “IF function”, ‘AVERAGEIFS”, “COUNT”, “COUNTIFS”, “BAR CHARTS”, “PIVOT TABLE”, and Power query to analyze the data set.

Data Cleaning

The dataset was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset. I cleaned the data checking for blank cells, blank columns as well as outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis

You can find the link to the excel file i used to work on the EDA. Including the cleaned data and every section of analysis that was carried out. https://1drv.ms/x/c/7e41e5bf9cbeb437/EWKiO5rmzn1LhrJHdffhJxMBe-2aBpZvlrOVSXgeDlAhyQ

Medical Conditions among Old and Young people

Firstly, I converted all ages below 40 years to “young” and ages above 40 years to “old”. I used these parameters as our basis for comparison.

After Analysis, we observed that the old people were diagnosed with mostly cancer and asthma. While the young people were diagnosed with mostly hypertension.


Age and Gender of Patients

In the dataset, the average age was 51 years with the youngest patient being 18 years and the oldest patient 85 years. The number of male patients was 4925 while the number of female patients was 5075. However, there were more older patients in both the male and female gender. The number of young patients was 3407 while the number of old patients was 6593. Therefore, the majority of the patients were over the age of 40.


Prevalence of each Medical Condition amongst Genders.

In the dataset, we observed that females were more commonly diagnosed with Cancer followed by asthma then obesity while males commonly presented with hypertension, arthritis and asthma in that order.

Age group Analysis

I went further to analyze the dataset and categorize the patients to specific age groups. I did this to find out the particular age group of patients that are more diagnosed with these diseases.

The patients were categorized into different age groups and the medical conditions was analyzed and visualised within the age groups.

From the result and chart, The age group with the highest count is 56–100, indicating that a significant portion of the patients in this dataset falls into the older age category. The fact that the 56–100 age group has substantially more patients (4444) compared to the other groups implies a notable representation of older individuals in the dataset.


Insurance Provider Analysis

The chart provides a summary of the billing amounts for different insurance providers for the patients. Cigna insurance has the highest total billing amount of approximately $52.34 million. Followed by other insurance providers. While medicare has the lowest billing amount. This data can help identify trends, assess the financial impact on healthcare providers, and inform decision-making in the healthcare industry.


Conclusion

Based on the presented data, I observed that older individuals are more likely to seek healthcare attention compared to their younger counterparts. However, the data does not provide specific reasons behind this trend. It is plausible that this tendency contributes to a higher incidence of diagnosed conditions among the elderly, potentially influencing their prevalence within the overall population.

Moreover, the data highlights a notable gender disparity, indicating that a larger number of females sought healthcare compared to males. The underlying factors behind this observation are not explicitly defined within the available data, suggesting the need for further in-depth analysis to uncover the contributing factors.

Recommendations

Recommendations for further analysis include exploring additional parameters that could help elucidate the observed discrepancies. Consider investigating factors such as the specific hospitals providing care, types of insurance coverage, and the total billing amounts for the healthcare services. A more comprehensive analysis of these variables may offer valuable insights into the patterns observed in the dataset, contributing to a more thorough understanding of healthcare-seeking behavior and potential influencing factors.
